 * Display management will consist of a loop that cycles round all
 * entities in the game asking them to move and then drawing them
 * in the appropriate place. With the help of an inner class it
 * will also allow the player to control the main ship.
 * <p>
 * As a mediator it will be informed when entities within our game
 * detect events (e.g. alient killed, played died) and will take
